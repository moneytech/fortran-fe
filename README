The goal of the g95 project is to create a free, open source Fortran
95 compiler. The code has been donated to the Free Software Foundation
for inclusion in GCC, the Gnu Compiler Collection.

WARNING:

G95 is still in an embryonic state. Perusing the g77 source, we
estimate that about 200,000 lines of code will be necessary to
implement g95. G95 is currently about 32,000 lines long, making it
about version 0.16. The current g95 does nothing except print the
contents of internal data structures.
