The goal of the g95 project is to create a free, open source Fortran 95
compiler. The code has been donated to the Free Software Foundation
for inclusion in GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection.

WARNING:

G95 is in a larval state. Perusing the g77 source, we estimate that
about 200,000 lines of code will be necessary to implement g95.  G95
is currently about 37,000 lines long, making it about version 0.185.
The current g95 does nothing except print the contents of internal
data structures.
