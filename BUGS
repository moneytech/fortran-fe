In a constant format string given to a data transfer statement, the
locus of any problems in the string isn't guaranteed to come out
right, because there is not a 1:1 correspondence between source
characters and characters in the string.  This scheme totally doesn't
work for format strings that are longer than a physical line.

Fix IMPLICIT to allow forward references of derived types.

Add binary tree to SELECT statement to detect overlapping cases

Array issues in expressions and intrinsics

USE statement
  Writing a module's namespace to disk
  Reading symbols into the current namespace
  Renaming of symbols

Resolve scoping issues
  Create symbols in correct namespaces

Pointer resolution

Require intents to be done correctly

Finish resolution phase

Finish compiler side of intrinsic functions (Katherine)

Allow init exprs to be numbers raised to integer powers (negative too)

See about making emacs-parsable error messages.
